/*A team of engineers was tasked with developing a program to calculate and manage the areas of multiple circles for a design project. To achieve this,
they devised a solution using a structured, object-oriented approach. At the foundation of their solution was a base class that represented a generic
shape, responsible for storing and managing the radius of the circle. Building upon this, a specialized class for circles was created to extend
functionality by introducing a method for calculating the area of a circle based on its radius. Using this framework, the team designed a system to handle
multiple circles, ensuring that the process of storing, calculating, and displaying the areas was efficient and adaptable. They explored two different
approaches for managing the collection of circlesâ€”one focusing on flexibility and dynamic handling, while the other used a more static structure. By
implementing and comparing these methods, the engineers gained insights into the benefits of using efficient techniques for organizing and processing
geometric data, enhancing their problem-solving capabilities.*/
