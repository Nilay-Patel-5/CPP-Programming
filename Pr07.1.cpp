/*A media research team is developing a tool to analyze word frequency in large textual datasets, such as news articles and research papers. The goal is to process a given
paragraph, identify individual words, and count their occurrences while ensuring case-insensitive matching. Since the tool is intended for both constrained environments and
high-performance systems, two different approaches are consideredâ€”one utilizing dynamic memory management and another relying on manually structured arrays.
The first challenge is reading an entire paragraph from the console as a single unformatted string. Once acquired, the text must be split into individual words, ensuring that
uppercase and lowercase variations are treated as the same. To store and process words dynamically, the team designs a
mechanism using raw pointers and dynamic memory allocation, allowing the program to handle variable input sizes effectively.
In one approach, a dynamically allocated array is used to store words, with additional logic to count occurrences efficiently. The array expands as needed, ensuring that new
words can be accommodated. The frequency counting is implemented manually by searching for existing words in the array and updating counts accordingly.*/
