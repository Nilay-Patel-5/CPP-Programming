/*A team of software developers was tasked with creating a graphical simulation where operations on 2D points play a crucial role.
To facilitate this, they designed a class Point that encapsulates the coordinates ùë• and ùë¶. The class provides flexibility through
overloaded operators to manipulate points efficiently. The unary operator - is overloaded to negate the coordinates of a point,
while the binary operator + enables the addition of two points. Additionally, the equality operator == is overloaded to compare
whether two points have identical coordinates.
The development process required performing various operations between multiple points. To manage these operations effectively, a
mechanism was needed to track and potentially undo them. This challenge prompted two approaches: using a ready-made dynamic stack
structure or building a custom stack implementation. By managing a sequence of operations in reverse, the stack-based design
allowed for a systematic undo capability, crucial for simulations involving iterative adjustments.*/
