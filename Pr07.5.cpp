/*A university administration is developing a system to display student marks in a structured and visually appealing format. The
goal is to ensure clarity in academic reports by properly aligning names and scores while also demonstrating the use of currency
formatting for tuition fees or other financial data. To achieve this, built-in stream manipulators such as endl, setw, setfill,
and setprecision must be used to create a neatly formatted output.
The system first reads student names and their corresponding marks, ensuring that the data is aligned in tabular form. Proper
spacing between columns enhances readability, preventing misalignment issues caused by varying name lengths or mark values.
Additionally, numerical values must be displayed with controlled decimal precision for consistency.
Beyond academic scores, the university also wants to format financial figures, such as tuition fees, in a standardized manner. To
achieve this, the system includes a user-defined manipulator, currency(), which prepends a specified currency symbol (â‚¹, $, etc.)
before displaying monetary values. This custom formatting ensures that financial data is both readable and professionally
presented.*/
