/*A community bank sought to enhance its account management system with a digital solution to improve efficiency and provide better customer service. The
system was required to manage the essential details of each account, including the account number, account holderâ€™s name, and balance. Additionally, the
bank wanted to provide a secure mechanism for transferring money between accounts, allowing customers to easily manage their funds.
The bank also needed a way to track the total number of accounts created, which would be important for generating reports and understanding the growth of
their customer base. This feature was aimed at helping the bank maintain an overview of their account portfolio and analyze trends over time.
To ensure smooth and reliable operations, the system was designed to store account information in a way that would allow easy access and updates. When new
accounts were created, they would be added to the system dynamically. The management team planned for future scalability and performance improvements by
considering more efficient storage and retrieval methods after the initial system was built, ensuring that the bank could easily accommodate more accounts
and transactions as the customer base grew.*/
