/*A software development team is tasked with designing a system that can handle various geometric shapes and compute their areas
in a flexible way. The challenge is to create a system that can easily extend to accommodate new types of shapes without altering
the core functionality for each shape. To accomplish this, the system is designed with a base class called Shape, which includes a
virtual function Area(). This function is meant to be overridden by each specific shape class to provide the correct formula for
calculating the area.
The derived classes, Rectangle and Circle, each implement the Area() function with their own formulas: the Rectangle calculates
the area using its length and width, while the Circle uses its radius. This structure allows the system to treat all shapes
uniformly through a common interface, enabling easy extensibility. The goal is to use a single reference to the base class
(Shape*) to calculate the area of any shape, regardless of its type. This approach makes the system more adaptable, as new shapes
can be added later without disrupting existing code.
In managing a collection of shapes, there are two primary approaches: one method involves dynamically managing a collection of
shapes, allowing for easy addition and removal of shapes, while the other relies on a static method that requires manually managing the size of the collection. Both approaches aim to store and manage the shapes effectively, with one allowing automatic resizing as needed while the other requires more manual handling.
Through this case study, the team will implement the base class Shape and the derived classes Rectangle and Circle, each with
their own Area() function. The students will gain a deeper understanding of polymorphism, inheritance, and memory management while
working with different methods to store and manage the collection of shapes.*/
